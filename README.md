# Dissertation code supplement
Archive of any dissertation-related matertials that hasn't already been published elsewhere. Most or all of this code and data are available elsewhere, where it may continue to evolve. This repository preserves a snapshot of a moment in time, and is unlikely to be updated.

The scna-tools directory contains a cancereffectsizeR tarball made from a development version of the software. If you're interested in cancereffectsizeR, check out its [repository](https://github.com/Townsend-Lab-Yale/cancereffectsizeR/). The associated reference data package is too large to store here; you can get it from this [download link](https://github.com/Townsend-Lab-Yale/ces.refset.hg38/archive/refs/tags/scna-preview.tar.gz).
